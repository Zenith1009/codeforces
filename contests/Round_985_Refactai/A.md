You are given a positive integer k and a set S of all integers from l to r (inclusive).
You can perform the following two-step operation any number of times (possibly zero):
1. First, choose a number xx from the set S, such that there are at least k multiples of x in S (including x itself);
2. Then, remove x from S (note that nothing else is removed).
Find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.

**Input**
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three integers l, r, and k (1≤l≤r≤10^9, 1≤k≤r−l+1) — the minimum integer in S, the maximum integer in S, and the parameter k.

**Output**
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.
